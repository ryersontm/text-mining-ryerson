**Abstract:**

Document classification is the task of assigning a document to one or more categories based on its content. The following research explores Graph Neural Network (GNN) models for document classification. GNN are capable of handling large complex structures and retaining global information (L Huang et al., 2019). This research proposes Message Passing GNN for document understanding. This is a replication study based on the paper Message Passing Attention Networks for Document Understanding.

**Report:**

Please reference the file **Message Passing Attention Graph Neural Networks for Document Classification.ipynb** for the report and implementation of the GNN

**Source Code:**

The src folder contains code for helper functions used by the GNN model, and the implementation for the baseline models (LSTM & Feed Forward Neural Network)

**Dataset:**

All datasets used for this project can be found in the data folder. For the pre-trained Google News vectors please use the following link to download the embeddings https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
