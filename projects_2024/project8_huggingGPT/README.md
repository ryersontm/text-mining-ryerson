# HuggingGPT

## Motivation
The primary objective of this repo is to go through the main steps of the 
implementation of the HuggingGPT paper. We will see how GPT-4 is used as an agent
for task planning and selection, and how Hugging Face Inference Api is used to 
connect several expert models for an AGI-like experience.

## Implementation
We breakdown the code presented in the HuggingGPT paper and go through the main steps,
replicating one of the examples presented: recognizing toppings in a pizza.
