    "# 1. Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The emergence of pre-trained models has revolutionized the applications of natural language processing. However, most of the pre-trained models do not perform well across different tasks limiting their applicability. The key objective of this study is to come up with a Neural Network architecture and pre-training methods for a language model with wider applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Context of the Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks for language modeling have been proven effective and accurate over statistical language modeling. However, training deep language models is time-consuming and computationally intensive. Pre-trained language models are appealing and have become an industry standard given the state-of-the-art performance, and also the fact that pre-trained models are available for general immediate use. Practitioners can focus on the actual Natural Language Processing (NLP) task than spending the time, hardware, and data to train models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of pre-trained language models is that they can function as a black box that understands the language and can then be utilized to perform any specific task in that language. A Pre-trained language model is the machine equivalent of a human being who deeply understands the language. Pre-trained models can be easily incorporated into new applications as they don't need much-labeled data, making them adaptable to various business problems, prediction, transfer learning, or feature extraction. Like the human counterpart, the pre-training model should be trained on a large corpus. It is not possible to label such a large dataset, therefore self-supervised training is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Masked Language model is the most remarkable approach in self-supervised NLP training. However, many of the masking methods (noising schemes) are task-specific and do not generate a generic language model. BART is a Neural Network model which combines both Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers and pre trains a model using a combination of noising schemes. It can be seen as generalizing many pretraining schemes and achieving noising flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.1 BERT: \n",
    "Random tokens are replaced with masks, and the document is bidirectionally encoded. BERT does not perform very well on downstream text generation tasks as the masked tokens are predicted independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.2 GPT: \n",
    "Tokens are predicted auto-regressively.  This means that each new prediction uses previously predicted tokens as context. This helps it perform very well on downstream text generation tasks. However, words can only condition in a leftward context, so they cannot learn bidirectional interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many masked training approaches, and some of these methods typically focus on particular types of end tasks (e.g., span prediction, generation, etc.), therefore not useful to train a generic language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "To pre-train a model, BART uses a combination of bidirectional and auto-regressive transformers. This technique has several advantages, including the ability to apply arbitrary alterations to the original text, such as adjusting its length. The research compares a variety of noise reduction techniques, determining the best results by shuffling the sequence of the original phrases at random and employing a new in-filling strategy in which any length text spans (including zero-length) are replaced with a single mask token.  By requiring the model to reason more about overall sentence length and apply longer-range modifications to the input, this technique generalizes BERT’s original word masking and next sentence prediction aims."

    "# 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Neural Network Architecture\n",
    "To understand the architecture of BART, it is important to comprehend the nature of the NLP tasks it aims to deal with. In-text summarization and question answering tasks, it is essential for the model to read the entire text and interpret each token in the context of what came before and after it. For example, to train a masked language model with the sentence “I am following a lecture in Natural Language Processing at a university”, the following masked sentence can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am following an [MASK] in Natural Language Processing at a university”.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) problem like this, it is important to completely read the sentence before predicting the [Mask] as it is highly dependent on the words \"university\" and \"following\". The bi-directional approaches to reading and representing a text can properly interpret input sequences in these cases. BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) introduced masked language\n",
    "modeling, allowing pre-training to learn interactions between left and right context words, hence improving the task of language modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "BART uses the bi-directional encoder of BERT to find the best representation of its input sequence. The BERT encoder produces an embedding vector of each token of its input text sequence and an extra vector of sentence-level information. This helps the decoder learn token and sentence level tasks which help in fine-tuning future tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The masked sequences are used in the pre-training process as shown in Figure 1. While a simple token masking technique is used in pre-training the BERT model, BART utilizes a more challenging masking procedure in its pre-training.\n",

    "A decoder is needed, after getting the representations of an input text sequence, to map these with the target output. However, if the decoder is designed in a similar way, it can perform poorly on next sentence prediction and token prediction tasks as it depends on more diverse input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, a model architecture is needed that can be trained on producing the next word by only examining preceding words in the sequence. Hence, an autoregressive model is useful as it only looks at the past data to predict the future. \n",

Therefore, the architecture is that of a typical sequence-to-sequence transformer as seen below. Both sections of the Transformer architecture are used in sequence-to-sequence models. There would be many layers of encoders and decoders stacked. The base BART Model has 6 encoders and decoders, and the large Model has 12 layers each.

This sort of model creates a statistical comprehension of the language it was trained on, but it isn't very effective for specific tasks. On the other hand, fine-tuning refers to the training that occurs after a model has been pre-trained. As a result, the general pre-trained model undergoes a process known as transfer learning. The model is fine-tuned in a supervised manner — that is, using human-annotated labels — on a specific task during this process. The question arises, why not just train for the final task straight away? There are several factors at play: \n",

This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. States or departments in four nations contain 'Amazonas' in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.\"\n",

    "# 5. Evaluation\n",
    "It is quite difficult to conduct a fair comparison of BART pre-training objectives against the previously employed pre-training objectives. There are differences in training data and resources, model architectural differences for example.\n",
    "Note that different models report different metrics: F1, EM, accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), mismatched version of MNLI (mnli-mm),  matched version of MNLI (mnli-m), Perplexities (PPL).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1 Evaluation metrics reported in the paper\n",
    "Two evaluations were performed. One on the base model and another evaluation of a larger model.\n",
    "### 5.1.1 Base model evaluation\n",
    "BART  implementations were compared with published numbers from BERT on similar training. BART was trained on 1M steps of books and Wikipedia data.All the following models are of base size.  There are 6 encoder and 6 decoder layers, with a hidden size of 768. That is 768 sized vector per word in the input sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different BART pre-training methods were evaluated\n",
    "- Token Masking\n",
    "- Token Deletion\n",
    "- Text Infilling \n",
    "- Document Rotation \n",
    "- Sentence Shuffling\n",
    "- Text Infilling + Sentence Shuffling \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the list of models compared against BART\n",
    "\n",
    "- BERT base \n",
    "- Language Model Similarly to GPT\n",
    "- Permuted language Model Based on XLNet\n",
    "- Masked language Model Following BERT\n",
    "- Multitask Masked language Model As in UniLM\n",
    "- Masked Seq-to-Seq inspired by MASS\n",

    "Performance varies across tasks, however BART models with text infilling demonstrate consistently strong performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.2 Large scale evaluation\n",
    "BART was trained on the same scale as the RoBERTa model.Therefore a  large model with 12 encoder layers and 12 decoder layers with a hidden size of 1024. The training was performed on a batch size of 8000, and train the model for 500000 steps, similar to RoBERTa.\n",
    "The following is the evaluatation of BART against the following models for discriminative tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 2: Large model evaluation for discriminative tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table 2](images/table2.png)\n",
    "BART performance is comparable to that of RoBERTa and XLNet. Therefore, can derive that BART’s uni-directional decoder layers do not reduce performance on discriminative tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the evaluation of BART against the following models for summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 3: Large model evaluation for summarization tasks with ROUGE scores.\n",
    "\n",

    "As expected, BART outperforms previous work on summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1 Evaluation on a custom dataset for classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In section 4.1.2.2 an experiment was carried out on a classification task on a custom dataset. The purpose of the classification was to identify the most likely product category label given a complaint narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal was to compare the classification performance of BART and BERT.\n",
    "BART should consistently perform all downstream tasks. BERT is supposed to perform better on discriminative tasks than BART.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the Weighted average metrics for the BERT base and BART base. Refer to section 4.1.2.2 for detailed scores per class.\n",

    "| BERT base | 0.84 | 0.84| 0.84| 0.85 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, BART performed better than BERT on this particular dataset. BERT was expected to perform better than BART on discriminative tasks like classification. All the performance metrics were identical except for precision where BART was 0.01 better. The difference in performance is not significant. However, it is a testament to the fact that BART is a consistently performing model over multiple downstream tasks."

    "# 6. Conclusion and Future Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "BART architecture is not that much different from the standard transformer architecture. The main experimentation was around pre-training. \n",
    "The paper's experiment on pretraining tasks may be concluded as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The effectiveness of pretraining approaches varies greatly depending on the task. However, the BART models with text infilling achieved consistently stronger performance.\n",
    "- BART consistently delivers strong results. Therefore, suitable as a generic model.\n",
    "- The importance of token masking cannot be overstated. \n",
    "- Pretraining from left to right enhances generation. \n",
    "- Architectural considerations are also important other than the pre-training tasks. For example, relative position embeddings and segment-level recurrence impact the performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of BART is also its weakness. The pretraining experimentation was to generate a generic language model that could be used across multiple downstream fine-tuning end tasks. Future work should then explore new methods of corrupting documents, maybe with the intent of being specific for certain downstream fine-tuning end tasks than being generic."
